					<h4>Daily Reading Group</h4>
				</p>
				<p>Love a good story? Come to the scene of the crime, the edge of adventure and timeless realms of wonder.
					<br>
					Join us from 12:05 p.m. to 12:50 p.m. every first and third Monday of the month at the Central Library, on Level 1 in the Microsoft Auditorium, for "Thrilling Tales: The Story Time for Adults." 
					<br>Looking for a story you heard at the Library? Selected recordings are available on the podcast page:
					<br>"The Interruption" by W.W. Jacobs
					<br>He had seen his wife safely to her grave, and yet his troubles were just beginning.
					<br>"The Betrayers" by Stanley Ellin
					<br>The walls were so thin you could hear anything through them, even murder. It's "Rear Window" -- minus the window!

					<h4>Daily Surf Trips</h4>
				</p>
				<p>One trip per day minimum, two if tides and swell are right. Our extremely knowledgeable, friendly, bilingual surf guides have full access to our vans and boats to take you to the best waves in northern Costa Rica. We know that if you booked our advanced surf tours, you donâ€™t need a whole lot of coaching and supervision. Think of this as having a local friend with access to and knowledge of all of the best spots who knows where to go from day to day based on swell, conditions, and tides.</p>

					<h4>Campfire: Improvised Ghost Stories</h4>
				</p>
				<p>Some stories are best told in the dark ... Take a trip back to the campfires of our childhood when  talented storytellers spin spooky stories around the fire. Our improvisers gather true-life events from YOU and turn them into improvised campfire stories and hilarious scenes. Some of the stories are scary and some are funny, and all of them will have you perched on the edge of your seat. Campfire has been an audience favorite for over a decade and is brought to you by Unexpected Productions' resident narrative improv troupe, Improv Anonymous.</p>
